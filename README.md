Traditionally, mass spectrometry (MS) output is the ion abundance plotted versus ionic mass-to-charge ratio m/z. While employing only commercially available equipment, Charge Determination Analysis (CHARDA) adds a third dimension to MS, estimating for individual peaks their charge states z, starting from z=1, and colour-coding z in m/z spectra. CHARDA combines the analysis of transient decay in Fourier transform (FT) MS with interrogation of mass defects. Being applied to individual isotopic peaks in a complex protein MS/MS dataset, CHARDA facilitates charge state deconvolution of large ionic species in crowded regions, estimating z even in the absence of isotopic distribution (e.g., for monoisotopic mass spectra). CHARDA is fast, robust and consistent with conventional FT MS and FT MS/MS data acquisition procedures. An effective charge resolution Rzâ‰¥6 is obtained, with potential for further improvements.
